            <hr>
            <p>
                As a second-year IT student at FEU Institute of Technology, I have developed a strong
                foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++, along with expertise 
                in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My experience includes creating functional
                applications, user-friendly websites, and innovative projects like a travel buddy app,
                a car rental system, and the Paluto App, which promote responsible consumption and 
                meaningful user experiences. I have worked collaboratively on group projects, employing Agile
                methodologies to ensure efficiency and on-time delivery. My skills also extend to database management,
                where I have designed and optimized ERD/EERD diagrams using Oracle SQL Developer. With a focus on
                problem-solving, I have contributed to developing predictive maintenance systems, simulation-enhanced
                load balancing solutions, and applications aligned with the 12th Sustainable Development Goal. Through
                technical writing, programming, and project development, I continue to strengthen my IT skills and contribute
                innovative ideas to technology-driven solutions.
